  Challenge 9

## Project Overview
I would like to open an ice cream and surf shop on a beach in Oahu; however, the weather can play a big role in the success of the business. W. Avy, a potential investor, is interested in the temperature data for the months of December and June. We had previously analyzed precipiation levels across a year long period and W. Avy was impressed with the results. Now, we want to impress him again with descriptive statistics on temperature data to show that the business is sustainable year-round. Results and conclusions are outlined below.

## Resources
            Data Sources: city_ride.csv & ride_data.csv
            
            Software: Python 3.9.7 & Jupyter Notebook
## Results
First, our June Analysis. As you can see below, we analyzed 1,700 data points to find the average, max and, min temperatures for the month. The temperature averaged just under 75 degrees and only saw a max of 85 degrees.

Second, the December analysis. In the table below, it shows we had 1,517 data points to analyze and the average temperature fell only a few degrees to 71. The max temperature was 85 degrees and the minimum was 56 degrees.

## Summary
It is important to note that temperature data includes minimum temperatures which likely fall at night when the store is closed and no one is surfing. Therefore, the minimum temperature of 64 degress likely falls when the business is not open.
